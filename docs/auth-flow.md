# Hi-Bridge Authentication Flow

## Overview

Hi-Bridge implements a secure, multi-step authentication system that includes:
- Email/Password authentication
- Social login (Google, Microsoft)
- Two-factor authentication
- Security questions for account recovery
- Session management

## Account Creation Flow

### Step 1: Initial Registration
- User fills out basic information:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Password (with strength validation)
- Account can be created via:
  - Direct registration form
  - Social login (Google, Microsoft)
- Validation:
  - Email format validation
  - Password strength check (min 8 chars, uppercase, number, special char)
  - Realtime visual feedback on password strength

### Step 2: Email Verification
- Verification email sent automatically
- User must click link in email to verify account
- Banner shows for unverified accounts with option to resend verification
- Access to all features is limited until verification is complete

### Step 3: User Onboarding
- After email verification, users complete profile setup:
  - Personal information
  - Role selection (Manager or Individual Contributor)
  - Team creation/joining
  - Work preferences

### Step 4: Security Setup (Optional)
- Two-factor authentication setup
- Security questions for account recovery
- Device management

## Login Process

### Standard Login
- Email/Password authentication
- "Remember Me" option for persistent sessions
- Password reset functionality

### Social Login
- One-click login via Google or Microsoft
- Proper OAuth flow with secure token management
- Account linking for existing users

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Optional second factor after password verification
- Support for:
  - Authenticator apps (TOTP)
  - Email verification codes
  - SMS codes (future)
- Backup codes for recovery

## Security Features

### Password Handling
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- Strength requirements enforced
- Regular password change reminders
- Breach detection and notification

### Session Management
- JWT token-based authentication
- Automatic session refresh
- Session timeout detection and handling
- Multiple device session tracking
- Ability to revoke sessions remotely

### Account Recovery
- Password reset via email
- Security questions as backup
- Admin-assisted recovery for enterprise accounts

## Error Handling

### Login Errors
- Generic error messages that don't leak security information
- Rate limiting for failed attempts
- Temporary lockout after multiple failures
- Notification for suspicious activity

### Registration Errors
- Clear validation messages
- Duplicate email detection
- Graceful handling of service unavailability

## Demo Mode
- Fallback when database or authentication services are unavailable
- Simulated authentication with mock data
- Clear indication to user that they are in demo mode

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- `users` - Core user information
- `profiles` - Extended user profile data
- `user_security` - 2FA settings, security questions (hashed)
- `sessions` - Active user sessions

### API Endpoints
- `/auth/signup` - Create new user account
- `/auth/login` - Authenticate existing users
- `/auth/verify` - Verify email address
- `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset functionality
- `/auth/2fa` - Two-factor authentication endpoints

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS for all communications
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Proper CORS configuration
- Data encryption for sensitive fields
