# Hi-Bridge Security Best Practices

## Account Security Measures

### Password Policy

- **Minimum Requirements**:
  - At least 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- **Password Strength Indicator**:
  - Visual feedback during password creation
  - Color-coded strength meter (red to green)
  - Real-time requirement validation
- **Password Storage**:
  - Passwords are never stored in plain text
  - Industry-standard hashing with Argon2 or bcrypt
  - Unique salt for each password

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- **Types Supported**:
  - Authenticator apps (TOTP)
  - Email verification codes
  - Future: SMS and WebAuthn (fingerprint, face ID)
- **Implementation Best Practices**:
  - Backup codes provided for recovery
  - Device remember option (30 days max)
  - Session persistence configurable by security policy

### Account Recovery Options

- **Email Recovery**:
  - Time-limited, single-use links
  - Rate-limited to prevent abuse
  - Properly logged for security auditing
- **Security Questions**:
  - Minimum of 3 questions required
  - Custom questions allowed
  - Answers stored with one-way hashing

### Session Management

- **Token Handling**:
  - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
  - Longer refresh tokens (2 weeks maximum)
  - Secure storage in HttpOnly cookies
- **Session Monitoring**:
  - Active session list available to users
  - Geo-location and device information
  - Ability to revoke individual or all sessions
- **Automatic Protection**:
  - Sessions expire after inactivity
  - Automatic refresh happens in background
  - Clear notification when sessions are about to expire

## User Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- **In Transit**:
  - TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Strict transport security (HSTS)
  - Forward secrecy support
- **At Rest**:
  - Database-level encryption
  - Field-level encryption for sensitive data
  - Key rotation policy

### Privacy Controls

- **User Data Access**:
  - Self-service profile management
  - Data export capability
  - Right to be forgotten (account deletion)
- **Minimized Data Collection**:
  - Only essential data is collected
  - Clear explanation of data usage
  - Explicit consent mechanisms

### Row Level Security

- **Database Protection**:
  - Supabase RLS policies for all tables
  - Users can only access their own data
  - Team access limited to appropriate members
- **Service Roles**:
  - Limited use of service roles for critical operations
  - Properly scoped permissions
  - Regular audit of service role access

## Infrastructure Security

### Application Security

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regular dependency updates
  - Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Software composition analysis
- **Code Security**:
  - Static application security testing
  - Secure coding practices
  - Regular security reviews

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Activity Logging**:
  - Authentication events
  - Critical data modifications
  - Administrative actions
- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Unusual login patterns
  - Unexpected access patterns
  - Geolocation changes

### Incident Response

- **Security Alerts**:
  - Real-time notification for suspicious activities
  - Escalation procedures
  - Automated temporary lockouts
- **Account Recovery**:
  - Clear processes for legitimate account recovery
  - Identity verification requirements
  - Support team training

## User Security Education

### In-App Guidance

- **Security Settings Discoverability**:
  - Prominent security menu
  - Security status indicators
  - Onboarding security setup wizard
- **Feature Education**:
  - Contextual help for security features
  - Explanations of security benefits
  - Visual guides for complex security setup

### Security Notifications

- **Proactive Alerts**:
  - New device logins
  - Password changes
  - Security setting modifications
- **Periodic Reminders**:
  - Security checkup prompts
  - Password update reminders
  - Two-factor authentication encouragement

## Demo Mode Considerations

### Security Simulation

- **Demo Authentication**:
  - Clearly labeled as demo mode
  - No real data stored
  - Similar security flows but with mock implementation
- **Feature Limitations**:
  - Password storage not implemented
  - 2FA simulation only
  - No real email verification

### Education Value

- **Security Awareness**:
  - Demonstrates security best practices
  - Shows proper authentication workflows
  - Encourages adoption of security features
